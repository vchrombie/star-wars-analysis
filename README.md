# star-wars-analysis
This repo is a part of the analysis made on the Star Wars data set to extract few interesting patterns.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vchrombie/star-wars-analysis/master?filepath=star-wars-analysis.ipynb)

I have written a well-documented notebook for this. You can fid it here, [star-wars-analysis](https://github.com/vchrombie/star-wars-analysis/blob/master/star-wars-analysis.ipynb). I am providing the [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) link so that you can test it out online. 

The dataset is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) and [data world](https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/star-wars-survey).

### Conclusions:
1. It seems like the movie "Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back" (rank5) is rated as the best so far and the "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith" (rank3) was the lowest rated movie here.
2. The last 3 movies were actually published earlier and are considered as "Original movies" which seems to be rated way higher than the first 3 prequels.
3. Also 'Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back' was seen by the least amount of people here, even if they liked it better. 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' was seen by more people, but was rated as low quality, which probably is a good signal of it's quality.
4. The first three movies were published later, when Star Wars already had a fan base, so it's possible that many people who expected better didn't like the prequel realeases.
5. 'Empire Strikes Back' was rated as the best movie both by male and female viewers, but it does seem like male users hated the prequels more, considering female users seemed to like the first movie of the prequel i.e 'Phantom Menace'. 'Revenge of the Sith' is hated by both male and female viewers.
